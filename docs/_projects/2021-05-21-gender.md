## The Elusive Domestic Revolution: Time Use and Gender Roles in Colombia (with [Andrea Otero](https://sites.google.com/view/andrea-otero-cortes/research), [Ana Maria Tribín](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/a/ana-maria-tribin-uribe) and [Juanita Villaveces](https://sites.google.com/view/gihpte/miembros/juanita-villaveces)) 

We examine the historical transformations in time use and gender roles in Colombia throughout the 20thcentury and their persistence in contemporary patterns. Drawing on census microdata and the 2016–2017 and 2020–2021 National Time Use Surveys, we document the evolution of paid and unpaid work across five generations of women and men. The findings confirm a swift increase in female labour force participation, particularly among highly educated women. However, the redistribution of household care lags, with perceptions of gender roles and social norms persisting. While women have succeeded in gaining a space in the public sphere, the division of unpaid work remains unequal, especially when kids are present in the household. Our analysis highlights the need for broader societal and policy interventions to address these structural disparities.
