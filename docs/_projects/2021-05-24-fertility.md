## The effects of geography and education on fertility behaviour: The case of Colombia in 1973
Colombia experienced one of the fastest declines in fertility in the world: children per woman fell from 7 in 1960 to 3 in 1985. Despite the stark inequalities of the country, the regional character of the decline has been neglected in previous research. This paper assesses the role of culture, geography and education during the Colombian fertility transition using individual-level data from the complete census of 1973. You can find a version of the most recent working paper [here]https://www.dropbox.com/s/sa9xsm8aqxacbui/Fertility_September_2021.pdf?dl=0) and a recent poster [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbas4cp8z6zm2kq/Poster_YDC.pdf?dl=0).
