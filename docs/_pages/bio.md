I am a PhD candidate from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Economic-History/People/PhDs/Juliana-Jaramillo). 

My PhD research focuses on the study of unequal social change in Colombia, and in particular, it focuses on how social status has persisted through history for different social groups and how the rapid decline in fertility that happened in 1960 varies for different regions and groups of women in the country.

Before coming to London I was working for the research staff of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia since 2013. During these years my research focused on impacts of [railways](https://repositorio.banrep.gov.co/bitstream/handle/20.500.12134/6125/be_838.pdf?sequence=1) and the [industrialization process](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/sites/default/files/seminariocede/892.pdf) in Colombia in the first half of the twentieth century, the [History of the Central Bank](https://repositorio.banrep.gov.co/bitstream/handle/20.500.12134/6998/?sequence=1) and the [evolution of living standards](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11698-018-0181-5).

I hold an Msc in Economic History from the London School of Economics, and a BA in Economics from University of Antioquia in Colombia.
