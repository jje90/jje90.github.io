I am a Junior Researcher at the [Central Bank of Colombia](https://investiga.banrep.gov.co/es) and I work at the Center of Regional Studies (CEER) in Cartagena, Colombia. My research interest sits at the intersection of economic history, historical development and demography and I combined different approaches and methodologies to study historical patterns of development and the historical evolution of regional inequality in several socioeconomic outcomes beyond economic growth.

In 2023 I obtained a PhD from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Economic-History/People/PhDs/Juliana-Jaramillo). My [PhD thesis](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/4476/) focused on the historical persistence of social status among different groups and how the rapid decline in fertility that happened in 1960 varies for different regions and groups of women in the country.

My research interests also extend to the impacts of [railways](https://repositorio.banrep.gov.co/bitstream/handle/20.500.12134/6125/be_838.pdf?sequence=1) and the [industrialization process](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/sites/default/files/seminariocede/892.pdf) in Colombia in the first half of the twentieth century, the [History of the Central Bank](https://repositorio.banrep.gov.co/bitstream/handle/20.500.12134/6998/?sequence=1) and the [evolution of living standards](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11698-018-0181-5).

I hold an Msc in Economic History from the London School of Economics, and a BA in Economics from the University of Antioquia in Colombia.
